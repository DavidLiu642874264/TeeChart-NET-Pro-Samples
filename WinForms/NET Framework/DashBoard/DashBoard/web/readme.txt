This web dashboard folder should be added as an IIS virtual folder

ie:
http://localhost/dashboard

That will permit the web report page to be opened from the export
button so that you can check output is as required.

eg.
http://localhost/dashboard/reports/index.html

The web output of the project uses a bootstrap template based on a page created by Creative Tim (https://www.creative-tim.com/)
